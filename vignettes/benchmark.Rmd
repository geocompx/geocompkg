# Reading vector data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
vector_filepath = system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package = "spData")
world = st_read(vector_filepath)
```

To demonstrate this, we will use a function to compare `st_read()` with its **sp** equivalent, `rgdal::readOGR()`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
b1 = bench::mark(iterations = 3, check = FALSE,
            sf = st_read(vector_filepath),
            sp = rgdal::readOGR(vector_filepath)
)
b1
```

The benchmark ran on an input file (`file`) and a number of times.
It shows that **sf** was `r round(as.numeric(b1$mean[2] / b1$mean[1]))` times faster than **rgdal** at loading this file.

The relative performance of `st_read()` compared with other functions will vary depending on file format and the nature of the data.
To illustrate this point, we performed the same operation on a geojson file and found a greater speed saving:

```{r, results='hide'}
vector_filepath = system.file("shapes/cycle_hire_osm.geojson", package = "spData")
b2 = bench::mark(iterations = 3, check = FALSE,
            sf = st_read(vector_filepath),
            sp = rgdal::readOGR(vector_filepath)
)
b2
```

In this case **sf** was around `r round(as.numeric(b2$mean[2] / b2$mean[1]))` times faster than **rgdal**.

# Writing vector data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rgdal)
world_sp = as(world, "Spatial")
```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
system.time(writeOGR(world_sp, dsn = "world_sp.geojson", layer = "world_sp.geojson", driver = "GeoJSON"))
system.time(writeOGR(world_sp, dsn = ".", layer = "world_sp", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")) 
system.time(writeOGR(world_sp, dsn = "world_sp.gpkg", layer = "world_sp.gpkg", driver = "GPKG"))
system.time(st_write(world, "world_sf.geojson", quiet = TRUE))
system.time(st_write(world, "world_sf.shp", quiet = TRUE)) 
system.time(st_write(world, "world_sf.gpkg", quiet = TRUE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
world_files = list.files(pattern = "world*")
file.remove(world_files)
```
