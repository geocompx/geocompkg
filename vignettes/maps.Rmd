This vignette builds on the [making maps chapter](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html) of [the Geocomputation with R book](https://geocompr.github.io/).

## Prerequisites {-}

The example below assume the following packages are attached:

```{r}
library(raster) # data download
library(tmap)   # map creation
```

# Hillshade map

Hillshade maps show the topographical shape of hills and mountains using levels of gray on a map.
The role of this kind of maps is to display relative slopes, but not absolute height.

## Calculate terrain characteristics 

Elevation data is needed to create a hillshade map.
The **raster** package provides an easy access to the SRTM 90 m resolution elevation data with the `getData()` function.
For example, it is possible to download the elevation data for the whole country of Slovenia using the code below:

```{r}
alt = getData("alt", country = "SVN", path = tempdir())
```

Hillshade maps are created based on certain terrain characteristics - slope and aspect.
Both of them can be calculated with the `terrain` function and the `opt` argument set to `"slope"` or `"aspect"`.

```{r}
slope = terrain(alt, opt = "slope")
aspect = terrain(alt, opt = "aspect")
```

Computing of a hillshade can be done using the `hillShade()` function. 
It requires previously created `slope` and `aspect` objects and setting two new arguments `angle` and `direction`.
The `angle` argument is the elevation angle of the light source and the `direction` argument is the direction (azimuth) angle of the light source (sun), both in degrees.

```{r}
hill = hillShade(slope, aspect, angle = 40, direction = 270)
```

The output object can be plotted with `plot(hill)`, however it does not give an expected map.
This is because the hillshade object should be overlayed by another semi-transparent layer to give a proper visualization.

## Create a hillshade map

A hillshade map can be created using the **tmap** package.
This package builds maps by stacking different data layers.
In this case, the first layer is the hillshade object (`hill`), colored using different levels of gray.

```{r}
tm_shape(hill) +
  tm_raster(palette = gray(0:10 / 10), style = "cont", legend.show = FALSE)
```

The second layer is the elevation object (`alt`), colored using the `terrain.colors` pallete.

```{r}
tm_shape(alt) +
  tm_raster(alpha = 0.5, palette = terrain.colors(10), style = "cont",
            title = "Elevation (m asl)", legend.show = TRUE)
```

Finally, both layers can be combined to create an expected visualization.
It could be also improved by placing the legend in the right bottom of the map.

```{r, fig.width=6}
tm_shape(hill) +
  tm_raster(palette = gray(0:10 / 10), style = "cont", legend.show = FALSE) +
  tm_shape(alt) +
  tm_raster(alpha = 0.5, palette = terrain.colors(10), style = "cont",
            title = "Elevation (m asl)", legend.show = TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("RIGHT", "BOTTOM"))
```
