# R for Transport Applications: Handling Big Data in Spatial World

<!-- ## Dates and prices -->

<!-- Next on: 26^th^ and 27^th^ April. -->

## Overview

This course teaches two skill-sets that are fundamental in modern transport research: programming and data analytics, with a focus on spatial data. Combining these enables powerful transport planning and analysis workflows for tackling a wide range of problems, including:

- How to find, download and import a range of transport datasets?
- How to develop automated and reproducible transport planning workflows?
- How can increasingly available datasets on air quality, traffic and active travel be used to inform policy?
- How to visualise results in an attractive and potentially on-line and interactive manner?

This course will provide tools, example code and data and above all face-to-face teaching to empower participants with new software to answer these questions and more.
The focus is on the programming language R. However, the principles and skills learned will be cross-transferable to other languages. By providing strong foundations in spatial data handling and the use of an up-coming language for statistical computing, R for Transport Applications aims to open a world of possibilities for generating insight from your transport datasets for researchers in the public sector, academia and industry alike.

As with any language, it is important to gain a strong understanding
of the underlying syntax and structure before moving on to complex uses. 
This course therefore starts with the foundations: how R can be used to load,
manipulate, process, transform and visualise spatial data.

In terms of content, the **first day** will focus on how the R language works, general concepts in efficient R programming, and spatial and non-spatial data classes in R. Building on this strong foundation the **second day** will cover the application of the skills developed in Day 1 to transport datasets, with a focus on geographical transport data.

## Learning objectives

### Day 1:

- Learn and consolidate the basics of R's syntax
- Discover time-saving tips for efficient programming
- Discover how add-on R packages such as **dplyr** can be used to improve productivity
- Understand how R can be used to read, process and save transport-related datasets
- Understand the structure of spatial data in R, including projections

### Day 2:

- Downloading and processing route network data from OpenStreetMap
- Be proficient in the use of R to create maps using add-on packages such as **tmap**
- Learn how to undertake specific transport planning tasks, including:
    - Formatting and processing origin-destination (OD) data
    - OD pair processing generate geographic desire lines
    - Route allocation using different routing services
    - Route network generation

### Prerequisites

Prior experience with transport datasets or common geographic data formats is **essential.**

Some exposure to software with a command-line interface, such as Stata, Python or R is **highly recommended**.

Attendees who are already proficient with their R programming skills are welcome to attend just the second day, although attendance of both days is recommended for most attendees: even advanced R users are likely to learn something on the first day.

**Computers** with RStudio installed will be available for course attendees. However, for maximum benefit, we recommend participants bring their own laptops, with the latest version of R installed.
Steps to set-up a suitable R/RStudio environment are described in sections [2.3](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#r-version) and [2.5](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio) of the book [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html).
It is also recommended the following packages are installed prior to attending the course:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c(
  "sf",
  "stplanr",
  "tidyverse",
  "tmap",
  "openair"
))
```
