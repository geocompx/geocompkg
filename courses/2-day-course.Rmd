## Geocomputation and Data Analysis with R

Geocomputation and Data Analysis with R is a 2 day course to be held on the 25^th^ and 26^th^ April 2019 in the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA).

## Aim

The aim of the course is to get you up-to-speed with high performance geographic processing, analysis and visualisation capabilities from the command-line.
The course will be delivered in R, a statistical programming language popular in academia, industry and, increasing, the public sector.
It will teach a range of techniques using recently developments in the package [**sf**](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) and the 'metapackage' [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), based on the open source book [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019]. 

## Learning objectives

## Prerequisites

### Prior experience

**Attendees should already have experience with R.**
In addition to being able to complete introductory course such as DataCamp's [introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) free course or equivalent, attendees should **already be using R** for their work.
This is not an introductory R course but a course for R users wanting to develop their geospatial analysis skills.
If you do not have R experience but already use GIS software and have a strong understanding for geographic data types, and some programming experience, the course may also be appropriate.

In preparation for the course we recommend reading and running the code in these free online resources:

- The introductory chapter of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
- Chapter 2 on [setting-up R](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html) and section 4.4 on [package selection](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html#package-selection) in the book *Efficient R Programming*

### Computing requirements

**Attendees are expected to bring their own laptop with the following packages installed and working.**
You can check these are all installed, and install those that are not installed, as follows (you can also just type `install.packages("sf")` etc):

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("osmdata")   # for working with open street map data
install.packages("sf")        # a package for working with spatial data
install.packages("spData")    # provides example data
install.packages("stplanr")   # a transport data package
install.packages("tidyverse") # metapackage for data science
install.packages("tmap")      # a mapping package

# Make sure your packages are up-to-date with:
update.packages()
```

## Reproducible example

The code in the following example checks you have the necessary packages installed.
It results in a map that will guide you to the location of the course.

**Please ensure the following commands work on your laptop before attending:**

Attach the packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(stplanr)
library(tidyverse)
```

The overall route assuming you're travelling from London:

```{r}
uk = spData::world %>% 
  filter(name_long == "United Kingdom")
origin_lnd = c(-0.1, 51.5)
destination = c(-1.55, 53.8)
odmatrix = matrix(c(origin_lnd, destination), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
line_lnd = st_linestring(odmatrix) %>% 
  st_sfc() %>% 
  st_sf(crs = 4326)
tm_shape(uk) +
  tm_polygons(col = "grey") +
  tm_shape(line_lnd) +
  tm_lines(col = "red", lwd = 5)
```
