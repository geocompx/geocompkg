# Why geo*?



## Geographic data is everywhere

--

## underlies some of society's biggest issues

--

## global analyses given local meaning


---


# Big issues?

# What packages work with spatial data?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The **tidyverse** now (mostly) works with spatial data.

This is thanks to **sf**, a recent package (first release in 2016) that implements the open standard data model *simple features*. Get **sf** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

Raster data is also supported, in the more mature package **raster**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("raster")
```


For datasets...:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```

For more on this see: [github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr).

## Context

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- In R, packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** have become immensely popular and now they are a part of the **tidyverse**
- These packages use the 'tidy data' principles for consistency and speed of processing (from `vignette("tidy-data")`):


>    - Each variable forms a column.
>    - Each observation forms a row.
>    - Each type of observational unit forms a table

- Historically spatial R packages have not been compatible with the **tidyverse**

---

## Enter sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of three previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*
    
That's the topic of this workshop

- Option 2: use *sh commands directly, e.g.:

```{r, engine='zsh'}
ls 
```

# System commands are handy

- Important step on path to programming
- Will help your R programming career
- Trick: shorten github URLs from the command-line:

## Reading and writing spatial data

```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)
prague_sf = read_sf("data/prague.geojson")
# same as:  st_read("data/prague.geojson")
```

`write_sf()/st_write()` writes data `st_write(prague_sf, 'data/prague_sf.gpkg')`. See supported formats with: `sf::st_drivers()`. Details: Chapter 6 of our book: [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html)

---

## Structure of the sf objects 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
prague_sf
```

```{r}
class(prague_sf)
```



```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# ---
## Structure of the sf objects
# world$name_long
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# world$name_long[1:3]
# ```
# 
# ```{r, eval=FALSE}
# world$geom
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# print(world$geom, n = 3)
```

---

## sf vs sp in the tidyverse

- **sp** precedes **sf**  
- Together with the **rgdal** and **rgeos** package, it creates a powerful tool to works with spatial data
- Many spatial R packages still depends on the **sp** package, therefore it is important to know how to convert **sp** to and from **sf** objects

```{r}
library(spData)
world_sp = as(world, "Spatial")
world_sf = st_as_sf(world_sp)
```

- The structures in the **sp** packages are more complicated - `str(world_sf)` vs `str(world_sp)`
  
--

- **sp** doesn't play well with the **tidyverse**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
world_sp %>% 
  filter(name_long == "England")
```

`Error in UseMethod("filter_") : 
  no applicable method for 'filter_' applied to an object of class "c('SpatialPolygonsDataFrame', 'SpatialPolygons', 'Spatial')"`

---

## Attribute operations: filtering

```{r, warning=FALSE}
world %>% 
  filter(name_long == "United Kingdom")
```

--

Base R equivalent:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world[world$name_long == "United Kingdom", ]
```

--

Question:

```{r}
identical(
  world %>% filter(name_long == "United Kingdom"),
  world[world$name_long == "United Kingdom", ]
) # ?
```

# Detour: Row names

- Usually don't matter but they can bite

```{r, }
u1 = world %>% filter(name_long == "United Kingdom")
u2 = world[world$name_long == "United Kingdom", ]
row.names(u2) = 1
identical(u1, u2)
```

--

- Advanced challenge: how to make u1 and u2 identical?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
attributes(u2) = attributes(u1)
identical(u1, u2)
attributes(u1$geom)
```

---

# Regex

- What does each of these produce?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world %>% filter(grepl(pattern = "United", x = name_long))
world[grepl(pattern = "United", x = world$name_long)]
grepl(pattern = "United", x = world$name_long)
world %>% filter(grepl(pattern = "^U", x = name_long))
world %>% filter(grepl(pattern = "m$", x = name_long))
world %>% filter(grepl(pattern = "Un|om", x = name_long))
```

---

## Aggregation

```{r}
world_cont = world %>% 
        group_by(continent) %>% 
        summarize(pop_sum = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(world_cont, n = 1)
```


- The `st_set_geometry` function can be used to remove the geometry column:

```{r}
world_df = st_set_geometry(world_cont, NULL)
class(world_df)
```

---

## Spatial operations

It's a big topic which includes:

- Spatial subsetting
- Spatial joining/aggregation
- Topological relations
- Distances
- Spatial geometry modification
- Raster operations (map algebra)

See [Chapter 4](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html) of *Geocomputation with R* 

---

## Spatial subsetting

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
lnd_buff = lnd[1, ] %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 27700) %>%  # uk CRS
  st_buffer(500000) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
near_lnd = world[lnd_buff, ]
plot(near_lnd$geom)
```

- What is going with the country miles away?

---

## Multi-objects

Some objects have multiple geometries:

```{r}
st_geometry_type(near_lnd)
```

Which have more than 1?

```{r}
data.frame(near_lnd$name_long,
           sapply(near_lnd$geom, length))
```

---

## Subsetting contiguous polygons

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 6}
near_lnd_new = world %>% 
  st_cast(to = "POLYGON") %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(., lnd_buff, sparse = FALSE))
plot(st_geometry(near_lnd_new))
```

---

# Tidyverse pitfall 1: row names

You can also do tidy spatial subsetting:

```{r, message=FALSE}
near_lnd_tidy = world %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(., lnd_buff, sparse = FALSE))
```

But a) it's verbose and b) it boshes the row names!

```{r}
row.names(near_lnd_tidy)
row.names(near_lnd)
```

- Consequences for joining - rownames can be useful! 

Also affects non-spatial data - [tidyverse/dplyr#366](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/366)

---

# Tidyverse pitfall 2: Duplicate column names

See [edzer/sf#544](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/544)

```{r}
names(world)
names(lnd_buff)
```

```{r}
lnd_buff$iso_a2 = NA
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_intersection(world, lnd_buff) # works
world_tidy = st_as_sf(as_tibble(world))
st_intersection(world_tidy, lnd_buff) # fails
```

```
Error: Column `iso_a2` must have a unique name
```

---

# Tidyverse pitfall 3: binding rows


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rbind(near_lnd, near_lnd) # works
bind_rows(near_lnd, near_lnd)
```

```
Error in .subset2(x, i, exact = exact) : 
  attempt to select less than one element in get1index
```

But this does:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
near_lnd_data = st_set_geometry(near_lnd, NULL)
d = bind_rows(near_lnd_data, near_lnd_data)
d_sf = st_sf(d, geometry = c(near_lnd$geom, near_lnd$geom))
plot(d_sf)
```

---

## CRS

```{r}
na_2163 = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") %>% 
  st_transform(2163) #US National Atlas Equal Area
st_crs(na_2163)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
na = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") 
png('slides/figs/coord_compare.png', width = 1000, height = 250)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(na[0]);plot(na_2163[0])
dev.off()
```

![](figs/coord_compare.png)

---
## Basic maps

- Basic maps of `sf` objects can be quickly created using the `plot()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(world[0])
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(world["pop"])
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
png('slides/figs/plot_compare.png', width = 800, height = 300)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,1,0))
plot(world[0]);plot(world["pop"])
dev.off()
```

![](figs/plot_compare.png)

---
## tmap

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("plot") #check the "view"
tm_shape(world, projection = "+proj=moll") +
        tm_polygons("lifeExp", title = "Life expactancy",
          style = "pretty", palette = "RdYlGn") +
        tm_style("grey")
```

---
## leaflet

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(world) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5,
                    fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp),
                    popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(widgetframe)
library('leaflet')
l = leaflet(world) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5, fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp), popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
frameWidget(l, height = '400')
```

---

## Raster data in the tidyverse

Raster data is not yet closely connected to the **tidyverse**, however:

- Some functions from the **raster** package works well in `pipes`
- You can convert vector data to the `Spatial*` form using `as(my_vector, "Spatial")`before working on raster-vector interactions
- There are some initial efforts to bring raster data closer to the **tidyverse**, such as [tabularaster](https://github.com/hypertidy/tabularaster), [sfraster](https://github.com/mdsumner/sfraster), or [fasterize](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize)
- The development of the [stars](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars), package focused on multidimensional, large datasets should start soon. It will allow pipe-based workflows
