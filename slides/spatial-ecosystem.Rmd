# Introduction 

- From the course's home at [github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr) and the website:

https://jr-packages.github.io/spatial/


This course will get you up-to-speed with using R and RStudio for daily working with spatial data.
You will learn about R's powerful geospatial data processing, analysis and visualisation capabilities.
It is practical and hands-on: you'll *learn by doing*.
It assumes you already use R and want to extend your knowledge for spatial data applications.
It will cover the recently developed **sf** package, which is compatible with the **tidyverse**, representing the cutting-edge of spatial data applications.
It will provide a solid foundation (including spatial aggregation, joining, CRSs, visualisation) on which advanced analysis analysis workflows can be built.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

---

# Learning outcomes

By the end of the course participants will:

 - Understand R's spatial ecosystem and which packages are 'future proof'
 - Know how to optimize RStudio for productive working with spatial data (you should already be proficient with RStudio)
 - Be able to read and write a variety of spatial data formats
 - Be proficient at common spatial operations including subsetting, cropping, aggregation and transformation
 - Be a confident map maker using the powerful **tmap** package
 - Know where to look for learning more advanced methods
 
---
 
# Prerequisites

In preparation for the course you should:

- Ensure that you have the latest versions of R and RStudio installed on your laptop: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Brush up on your R skills if you're not an R user, e.g. with:
    - This excellent tutorial that you can work through to get used to the interface: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
    - A more detailed account by Gillespie and Lovelace (2017): https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio
- Take a look at how GitHub works - we'll be using it for sharing course materials and sharing links and examples during the course, e.g. by reading this page (and following the tutorial if really keen): https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

---

# Test your set-up

This should work:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(spData)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Why Geocomputation with R?

.pull-left[

Why geocomputation?

- 'Does what it says on the tin'
- Emphasis on 'tools' + flexibility
- Link to Leeds (Jakub and Robin joined forces at the [GeoComputation 2017](http://www.geocomputation.org/2017/conference/) conference)

Why R?

- We all speak R!
- It's good for academic research (statistical rigour, reproducibility)
- It's a good bridge/interface language (see Chapter [9 on bridges](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/gis.html))

- It's got an awesome community!

# What is Geocomputation?


.pull-left[

> GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a 'scientific' approach `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

- But we do differ from early definitions in one important way:

> At the turn of the 21st Century it was unrealistic to expect readers to be able to reproduce code examples, due to barriers preventing access to the necessary hardware, software and data

---

# Other aspects of the definition

--

> What distinguishes geocomputation from the older quantitative geography, is its emphasis on "creative and experimental" GIS applications `r Citep(my_bib, "longley_geocomputation_1998", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

It's about doing "practical work that is beneficial or useful" `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

> about harnessing the power of modern computers to *do things* with geographic data.

---

# What's in the geocompr box?

.pull-left[

- Chapter 1: History + 'philosophy' = important

Foundations

- Starting from nothing
- Class definitions
- Spatial/attribute operations
- Projections 
- Data IO

Extensions

- Advanced methods
- How to build your own functions

Applications

- A taster of what you can do

# A brief history of geographic data in R

R's predecesor was S, which was itself inspired by lisp `r Citep(my_bib, "chambers_extending_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

This is geographic analysis in S `r Citep(my_bib, "rowlingson_splancs_1993", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`:

```
pts <- spoints(scan('cavities'))
uk()
pointmap(pts,add=T) 
zoom()
uk(add=T) 
pointmap(pts,add=T)
poly<-getpoly() 
```

Still works today, 25 years later:

```{r}
library(splancs)
#> Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Code in S-Plus
#> Version 2 - Spatial and Space-Time analysis
```

---

# Live demo (try this)!

```{r, fig.height=4}
# install.packages("splancs"); library(splancs)
# example, interactive! (commented bits)
data(bodmin)
plot(bodmin$poly, asp=1, type="n")
pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
# zoom()
# pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
```

---

# Observations
- R' is robust and future-proof 

- See a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luxllb_WAqY) of Roger Bivand's talk on the subject (live demo of R 0.49) + GitHub [repo](https://github.com/rsbivand/eRum18/blob/master/eRum_keynote_18.Rmd)

- Rs capabilities have evolved substantially since then!

---


# Case study: Geographic data visualization

- An area that illustrates the pace of development
- Rapid growth in number and diversity of packages
- Consolidation, but still many packages to choose from
- `plot()` still best for many tasks

--

- Vital for understanding geographic data. 

--

- Empower youselves with maps!

# Base R graphics: sp code

Credit: [asdar-book.org/](http://asdar-book.org/), reproducible code accompanying the book Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R (Pebesma et al. 2013).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

plot(nz_height_sp, cex = 2)
title("points")
plot(nz_sp, col = "grey")
plot(nz_height, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

--

## Observations

- Passes arguments (e.g `cex` for symbol size) to `graphics::plot()`
- New command for each additional 'layer' (e.g. `title()`, `plot(..., add = TRUE)`)
- Black and white default output style
- Fast

# tmap

- A diverse dedicated mapping R package

```{r}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons("Median_income", palette = "RdYlBu")
```

---

# Why tmap?

- It is powerful and flexible.
- Concise syntax, attractive maps with minimal code, familiar to **ggplot2** users.
- Unique capability: same code -> static + interactive maps with switch `tmap_mode()`.
- Wide range of spatial classes (including `raster` objects) supported.
- Well documented + developed --- see [`tmap-nutshell`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html) and JSS paper
`r Citep(my_bib, "tennekes_tmap_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.



```{r, fig.cap="tmap basics", out.width="32%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# tmap basics
# Add fill layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill() 
# Add border layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders() 
# Add fill and border layers to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill() + tm_borders() 
```

---

# Animations

```

---

# Before spatial packages...

- Coordinates were treated as *just another variable*
- Issues with visualisation, spatial relations and consistency
- Major issues with Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs)

```{r}
library(spData) # see data(package = "spData") and ?afcon for more info
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
plot(afcon$x, afcon$y)
```

---

# sp

- Released in 2005 (Pebesma and Bivand 2005)
- Raster and vector data (but mostly raster) supported
- We *won't* be using it but it *is* useful to know about ()

```{r}
library(sp)
data(meuse)
coords = SpatialPoints(meuse[c("x", "y")])
meuse = SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, meuse)
str(meuse)
```

---

# sp visuals

12 year-old code still works ([Pebesma and Bivand 2005](https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2005-2.pdf))

```{r}
plot(meuse, pch=1, cex = .05*sqrt(meuse$zinc))
```

---

# Packages building on sp

**sp** has many *reverse dependencies*:

```{r}
sp_revdeps = devtools::revdep("sp", dependencies = "Depends")
head(sp_revdeps)
length(sp_revdeps)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dd = cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = sp_revdeps,
                              from = "2013-01-01", to = Sys.Date())
dd$Downloads = ave(
  dd$count,
  dd$package,
  FUN = function(x)
    zoo::rollmean(x, k = 30, na.pad = T)
)
top_pkgs = dd %>% 
  filter(date > (Sys.Date() - 30)) %>% 
  group_by(package) %>%
  summarise(Downloads = mean(Downloads, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  top_n(n = 5, wt = Downloads) %>% 
  pull(package)
dd = dplyr::filter(dd, Downloads > 0, package %in% top_pkgs)

library(ggplot2)
ggfig = ggplot(data = dd, mapping = aes(date, Downloads, color = package)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", color = "Package: ")
ggsave("figures/sp-dep-package-growth.png", ggfig)
```


```{r}
sp_revimps = devtools::revdep("sp", dependencies = "Imports")
length(sp_revimps)
```

---

# Where to find out about packages?

Online (dur) but with guidance, e.g. from:

- The Spatial Taskview: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html
- Section 4.4. of [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html#package-selection)

A few of note:

- **adehabitat** for ecological modelling
- **geosphere** for operations on a spherical surface
- **spdep** for modelling spatial data
- **rgdal** for reading/writing data
