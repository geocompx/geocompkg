## Housekeeping

- The venue + facilities
- The agenda + further info can be found at:
- https://git.io/geocompr-2-day-course

```{r itsmap, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(osmdata)
library(tmap)
lida = opq("Leeds") %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "Worsley Building") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
# m = mapview::mapview(lida$osm_polygons, zoom = 16)
lida_centroid = lida$osm_polygons %>% 
  sf::st_centroid()
lon = sf::st_coordinates(lida_centroid)[1]
lat = sf::st_coordinates(lida_centroid)[2]
m = tm_shape(lida$osm_polygons) +
  tm_polygons(col = "red") +
  tm_view(set.view = c(lon + 0.005, lat - 0.005, 15)) +
  tm_basemap(server = leaflet::providers$CartoDB.Positron) +
  tm_minimap(server = leaflet::providers$OpenTopoMap, zoomLevelOffset = -10) +
  tm_scale_bar()
tmap_mode("view")

## Learning objectives

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Be able to use R and RStudio as a powerful Geographic Information System (GIS)
- Know how R's spatial capabilities fit within the landscape of open source GIS software
- Be confident with using R's command-line interface (CLI) and scripting capabilities for geographic data processing
- Understand how to import a range of data sources into R
- Be able to perform a range of attribute operations such as subsetting and joining
- Understand how to implement a range of spatial data operations including spatial subsetting and spatial aggregation
- Have the confidence to output the results of geographic research in the form of static and interactive maps

## What is geocomputation?

.pull-left[

> GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a 'scientific' approach `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

]

```

- But we do differ from early definitions in one important way:

> At the turn of the 21st Century it was unrealistic to expect readers to be able to reproduce code examples, due to barriers preventing access to the necessary hardware, software and data

---

## Other aspects of the definition

--

> What distinguishes geocomputation from the older quantitative geography, is its emphasis on "creative and experimental" GIS applications `r Citep(my_bib, "longley_geocomputation_1998", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

It's about doing "practical work that is beneficial or useful" `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

> about harnessing the power of modern computers to *do things* with geographic data.

# Introduction to the course and software

---

## An introduction to R

---
<!-- - R installation questions/debugging -->
<!-- - How to use RStudio (practical in groups of 2) -->
<!-- - R classes and working with data frames in the **tidyverse** -->

<!-- Idea: get people to say where they are from, how many cups of coffee they drink per week their favourite animal -->

---

### R's spatial ecosystem

<!-- - Live demo: using R as a GIS -->
<!-- - Spatial data in R -->
<!-- - R's spatial ecosystem (see section [1.4 of Geocomputation with R - package ecosystem](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html#rs-spatial-ecosystem)) -->
<!-- - Practical: [Work through the exercise 1:3 in Chapter 2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html#ex2) -->
<!--     - Advanced: complete exercises in Chapter 2 -->
<!--     - Bonus: reproduce the results in the `sf` vignette `sf1` -->

<!-- And example from the PCT -->

**Lunch**

13:30-15:00 The structure of vector geographic data in R and working with attribute data

<!-- - Vector attribute subsetting -->
<!-- - Vector attribute aggregation -->
<!-- - Vector attribute joining -->
<!-- - Creating attributes and removing spatial information -->

<!-- - Exercises: Chapter [3](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/attr.html#exercises-1) -->
